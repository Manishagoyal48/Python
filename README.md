# Python
Presents a menu with four options: add, show, mark done, or exit.

Adding: lets the user add multiple tasks at once, storing each as a dictionary with "task" and a boolean "done" flag.

Showing: displays all current tasks with a “Done” or “Not Done” label.

Marking as Done: the user can mark a task by its index in the list.

Exiting: gracefully ends the program.
